# Cluster Analysis
This folder contains the necessary code for the Cluster Analysis. 
## Folder files

 + **utils.py**: This file contains utility functions that are used in other notebooks. These functions may include common data processing tasks, helper functions, or any other functionality that is shared across different parts of the project.

 + **first_clustering_stage.ipynb**: In this Jupyter notebook, the first stage of the clustering analysis is explained. This includes data exploration, preprocessing, and the application of the initial clustering algorithm. Any important insights or observations related to the first stage of clustering should be documented here.

 + **second_clustering_stage.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook focuses on the second stage of the clustering analysis. It could involve refining the clusters obtained from the first stage, incorporating additional features, or using a different clustering algorithm. Detailed explanations, visualizations, and key findings related to the second stage should be presented in this notebook.

 + **clustering_prediction.ipynb**: This notebook is dedicated to the creation of a prediction algorithm. The algorithm is designed to predict the corresponding cluster group for new records based on the insights gained from the clustering stages. The notebook should include the algorithm implementation, model evaluation, and any considerations for deploying the prediction algorithm in a real-world scenario.
