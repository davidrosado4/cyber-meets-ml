# Cluster Analysis
This folder contains the necessary code for the Cluster Analysis. 
## Folder files

 + **utils.py**: This file contains utility functions that are used in other notebooks. These functions include common data processing tasks and helper functions.

 + **first_clustering_stage.ipynb**: In this Jupyter notebook, the first stage of the clustering analysis is explained. This includes the study of two clustering algorithms for the first partition of the data.

 + **second_clustering_stage.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook focuses on the second stage of the clustering analysis. It involves the use of two more clustering algorithms for further divide the partition created in the first stage.

 + **clustering_prediction.ipynb**: This notebook is dedicated to the creation of a prediction algorithm. The algorithm is designed to predict the corresponding first stage cluster group for new records.
