    "Analyzing the components of a time series is a critical step that provides a wealth of valuable information before applying classical forecasting models. Each component, trend, seasonality, and noise, carries distinct insights, contributing to a comprehensive understanding that forms the basis for effective modeling. The components of a time series are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trend**: A gradual shift or movement to relatively higher or lower values over a long period of time.\n",
    " - When the time series analysis shows a general trend , that is upward . It is called uptrend.\n",
    " - When the time series analysis shows a general trend , that is downward. It is called downtrend.\n",
    " - When there is no trend, we call it horizontal or stationary trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Seasonality**: Patterns of variation that repeat at specific time intervals. These can be weekly, monthly, yearly, etc. Seasonal changes indicate deviations from the trend in specific directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Residuals**: Unusual events that occur in the data, such as a sudden increase in heart rate for a person during exercise. These cause random errors and are also referred to as “white noise.”"

    " - **Visual Inspection**: Plotting the time series data can often reveal the presence of a trend. A clear upward or downward movement over time suggests the presence of a trend component. Visual inspection allows you to observe the overall pattern and identify any deviations or changes in the series.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Moving Averages**: Moving averages are widely used for trend analysis. They help smooth out short-term fluctuations in the data, making it easier to identify the underlying trend. Common types of moving averages include the simple moving average (SMA), weighted moving average (WMA), and exponential moving average (EMA)."
