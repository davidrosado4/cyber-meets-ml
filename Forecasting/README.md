 + **classical_models.ipynb**: In this notebook, we explore two classical forecasting models - ARIMA and Prophet. Detailed explanations, parameter tuning, and performance evaluations for each model are provided.
 + **ML_approach.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on the application of a machine learning framework for time series forecasting. Various machine learning models are explored, and their performance is assessed using relevant metrics.
 + **LSTM.ipynb**: In this notebook, we delve into the use of recurrent neural networks, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for time series forecasting. The implementation, training, and evaluation of the LSTM model are discussed.
